This website is my first project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I choosed the theme of "priming" in psychology after i read the Book "Thinking fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman.
I've kept everything simple to not overload the user with animations or buttons everywhere.
Please give me you're feedback, I'll appreciate it , thanks !
